# Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to analyze employee attrition trends within a company using Excel. The dataset includes various employee attributes such as age, department, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and relationship status to identify key factors influencing attrition.


## üóÇ Dataset Details

 The dataset consists of employee records with the following key attributes:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Distance from Home, Education Field
 
- **Job Details:** Job Role, Department, Business Travel, Years at Company
 
- **Satisfaction Metrics:** Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction

- **Compensation & Benefits:** Monthly Income, Percent Salary Hike, Stock Option Level

- **Attrition Status:** Indicates whether the employee left the company

## Observations from the Dashboard and Heat Map:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Analysis
It looks like the Dashboard sheet is empty in the extracted preview. This could be due to visual elements (charts, slicers) that are not directly readable as data. However, based on your project structure, I assume the dashboard presents key KPIs and visualizations such as:

Attrition rate

Attrition by department, age group, and work-life balance

Salary hikes vs. attrition trends

To analyze it further, I can suggest improvements if you describe the visuals you have included.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Heat Map Insights
The heat map sheet provides a correlation analysis of different factors affecting attrition. Here's what I observed:

Work-Life Balance vs. Attrition:

Employees with a low work-life balance (1 or 2) have a significantly higher attrition rate than those with a balance of 3 or 4.

Example:

25 employees with WLB = 1 left (out of 55 with WLB = 1).

58 employees with WLB = 2 left (out of 286 with WLB = 2).

127 employees with WLB = 3 left (out of 766 with WLB = 3).

27 employees with WLB = 4 left (out of 126 with WLB = 4).

Insight: Employees who rate their work-life balance lower are more likely to leave.

Overall Attrition Numbers:

Total Employees: 1,470

Attrition (Left the Company): 237 Employees (16.1%)

Retained Employees: 1,233 Employees (83.9%)

Insight: The company's overall attrition rate is around 16%, which is moderate. However, deeper analysis is needed for departments and job roles.

## üî• Key Takeaways
Work-life balance is a major driver of attrition ‚Äì employees with poor work-life balance tend to leave more.

A significant portion of employees have a WLB rating of 3 (766 employees), meaning it‚Äôs neutral but could decline if not addressed.

Employees with higher WLB ratings (4) show lower attrition rates, implying that improving work-life balance policies could enhance retention.


## ‚öíÔ∏è Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting

Data Visualization: Bar Charts, Heat Maps, KPI Metrics

## üöÄ Conclusion

This project provides actionable insights into employee attrition trends. Understanding these patterns can help HR teams develop strategies to improve employee retention.
