# Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to understand analyze employee attrition trends within a company using Excel. The dataset includes various employee attributes such as age, department, job satisfaction, work-life balance, and relationship status to identify key factors influencing attrition.Attrition is a vital metric for HR professionals and leadership teams.


## üóÇ Dataset Details

 The dataset consists of employee records with the following key attributes:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Distance from Home, Education Field
 
- **Job Details:** Job Role, Department, Business Travel, Years at Company
 
- **Satisfaction Metrics:** Work-Life Balance, Job Satisfaction, Relationship Satisfaction

- **Compensation & Benefits:** Monthly Income, Percent Salary Hike, Stock Option Level

- **Attrition Status:** Indicates whether the employee left the company

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Analysis
It looks like the Dashboard sheet is empty in the extracted preview. This could be due to visual elements (charts, slicers) that are not directly readable as data. However, based on your project structure, I assume the dashboard presents key KPIs and visualizations such as:
**1. Attrition Overview**
  - Total Employees: 1,470

  - Ex-Employees: 237

  - Total Active Employees: 1,233

  -  Attrition Rate: 16%

  - This attrition rate suggests a moderate level of employee turnover. HR should investigate whether this turnover is voluntary or involuntary and assess if it is industry-standard.

**2. Job Satisfaction & Attrition**
  - A significant number of very satisfied employees (52) and satisfied employees (73) still left the company.

  - However, 66 very dissatisfied and 46 dissatisfied employees also left, indicating that dissatisfaction does contribute to attrition.

  - HR should conduct exit interviews to understand why even satisfied employees are leaving.

**3. Attrition by Job Role**
  - The highest attrition is seen in Laboratory Technicians (62), Research Scientists (47), and Sales Executives (57).

  - Research and Sales roles may have high pressure, requiring better incentives, career growth, or workload management.

**4. Attrition by Education Level**
  - Employees with Life Sciences (89) and Medical (63) degrees face the highest attrition.

  - HR should investigate whether these employees are moving to competitors for better benefits or if the company lacks growth opportunities for them.

**5. Attrition by Department**
  - Research & Development (56.12%) has the highest attrition, followed by Sales (38.82%).

  - HR should check if compensation, career growth, or workplace stress is causing high turnover.

**6. Attrition by Age Group**
  - 26-35 age group (116 employees) has the highest attrition.

  - This is typically when employees seek career growth, better salaries, or switch industries.

  - HR should implement career progression plans to retain mid-level employees.

**7. Attrition by Work Experience**
  - Employees with 0-10 years of experience (182) have the highest attrition.

  - This suggests early-career employees are leaving, possibly for better opportunities.

  - HR should strengthen employee engagement, training, and mentorship programs.

**8. Attrition by Work Distance**
  - The majority of employees leaving (144) live nearby.

  - While commute time isn‚Äôt the biggest issue, HR can still explore remote work options for flexibility.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Heat Map Insights
The heat map sheet provides a correlation analysis of different factors affecting attrition. Here's what I observed:

**Work-Life Balance vs. Attrition:**

Employees with a low work-life balance (1 or 2) have a significantly higher attrition rate than those with a balance of 3 or 4.

Example:

 - 25 employees with WLB = 1 left (out of 55 with WLB = 1).

 - 58 employees with WLB = 2 left (out of 286 with WLB = 2).

 - 127 employees with WLB = 3 left (out of 766 with WLB = 3).

 - 27 employees with WLB = 4 left (out of 126 with WLB = 4).


## üî• Key Takeaways
- Focus on retention stratergies is needed especially for Sales and R&D teams following internal surveys to determine if it's due to workload,
  management, or salaries.

- Offering competitive salaries and leadership development for Mid-Level employees can help in retention.

- Work-life balance is a major driver of attrition ‚Äì employees with poor work-life balance tend to leave more.

- A significant portion of employees have a WLB rating of 3 (766 employees), meaning it‚Äôs neutral but could decline if not addressed.

- Employees with higher WLB ratings (4) show lower attrition rates, implying that improving work-life balance policies could enhance retention.


## ‚öíÔ∏è Tools Used

Microsoft Excel: Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Conditional Formatting

Data Visualization: Bar Charts, Heat Maps, KPI Metrics

## üöÄ Conclusion

This project provides actionable insights into employee attrition trends. Understanding these patterns can help HR teams develop strategies to improve employee retention.
